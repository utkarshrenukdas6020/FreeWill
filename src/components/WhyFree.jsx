        <p className="mission">
          Our mission is to enable you to do the most good for the people and causes you love, 
          by providing free access to will-making services. We've partnered with 1900+ nonprofits 
          and businesses who support our mission and help ensure you can create a will for free, 
          while raising more than $11.3B+ in bequests to charities.
        </p>
        <p className="impact">
          One in six people who use FreeWill choose to leave a bequest to charity. They believe, 
          as we do, that leaving a bequest to nonprofit organizations in your will can be an 
          incredibly powerful way to make an impact for the causes you support.
